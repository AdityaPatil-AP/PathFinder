SFML - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
SFML is multimedia.
SFML provides a simple interface to the various components of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications. It is composed of five modules: system, window, graphics, audio and network.

SFML is a multimedia library, meaning that it provides a layer between you and the hardware. It is split into five modules:

System: This is a core module upon which all other modules are built. It provides two-dimensional and three-dimensional vector classes, clocks, threads, and Unicode strings, among other things.

Window: The Window module makes it possible to create application windows, and to collect user input, such as mouse movement or key presses.

Graphics: This module provides all functionalities that are related to two-dimensional rendering, such as images, texts, shapes, and colors.

Audio: SFML also offers a module to work with sound. When you want to load a music theme and play it on the computer's loudspeakers, this is the module you have to look for.

Network: Another medium SFML covers is the network, a more and more important part of our interconnected world. This module allows you to send data over LAN or the Internet; it also lets you work with protocols, such as HTTP or FTP.
